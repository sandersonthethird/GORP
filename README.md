## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or later recommended)
- **npm**
- **Deepgram API key** — for real-time transcription ([get one here](https://console.deepgram.com/))
- **Anthropic API key** — for AI summaries and chat ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))
- **Google OAuth credentials** — for Calendar and Drive integration
- **Ollama** *(optional)* — for local LLM support ([install Ollama](https://ollama.com/))

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sandersonthethird/GORP
cd gorp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Once the app launches, open **Settings** to configure your API keys (see below).

## API Key Setup

GORP requires your own API keys — no keys are included with the app. All keys are encrypted and stored locally on your machine using Electron's safe storage.

### 1. Deepgram (required for transcription)

1. Sign up for a free account at [console.deepgram.com](https://console.deepgram.com/signup)
2. Go to **API Keys** in the Deepgram dashboard and create a new key
3. In GORP, open **Settings > Transcription** and paste your key

Deepgram's free tier includes $200 in credit, which covers many hours of transcription.

### 2. Anthropic (required for AI summaries and chat)

1. Sign up at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Go to **Settings > API Keys** and create a new key
3. In GORP, open **Settings > Summarization**, select **Claude**, and paste your key

> **Free alternative:** If you'd prefer not to use a paid API, select **Ollama** as your LLM provider in Settings. [Install Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and run a model locally at no cost.

### 3. Google Calendar & Drive (optional)

To auto-detect meetings and upload files to Drive, connect your Google account in **Settings > Google Calendar**. The app will walk you through creating OAuth credentials.
